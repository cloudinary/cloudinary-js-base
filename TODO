[V] use tsc to build into /dist/esm (as ESM!)
[V] use rollup to bundle into /dist/bundles/umd
[V] use tsc to create types in /dist/types
[V] create entry points to actions
[V] delete /dist/ before running a new build

[ ] What is transpiled by babel?
[ ] Lint rules in typescript?





// Comments
- We publish /dist and not the main package.



// end result:
import {Resize, TransformableImage} from '@cloudinary/base';
import Resize, {crop} from '@cloudinary/base/actions/resize';



// things to avoid
import {Resize, TransformableImage} from '@cloudinary/base'; regular import looks like this
import {Resize, TransformableImage} from '@cloudinary/base/dist/umd/base.js'; umd import looks like this
import Resize, {crop} from '@cloudinary/base/actions/resize';




// Tests for our build
- UMD works as a script tag in browser
- ESM works as a script tag in browser
- Can import ESM with autocomplete
- Can import UMD with autocomplete
- Test entry points to actions (We need a live project somehow?)
