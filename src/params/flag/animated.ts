/**
 * @memberOf Params.Flag
 * @description Used when delivering a video file as an image format that supports animation, such as animated WebP.
 * Plays all frames rather than just delivering the first one as a static image.
 * Use this flag in addition to the flag or parameter controlling the delivery format,
 * for example f_auto or fl_awebp.

 * Note: When delivering a video in GIF format, it is delivered as an animated GIF by default and this flag is not
 * necessary. To deliver a single frame of a video in GIF format, use the page parameter.
