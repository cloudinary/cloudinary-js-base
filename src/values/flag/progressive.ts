 * @description Generates a JPG image using the progressive (interlaced) JPG format.
 *
 * This format allows the browser to quickly show a low-quality rendering of the image until the full-quality
 * image is loaded.
 *
 * @param {string} mode The mode to determine a specific progressive outcome as follows:
 * * semi - A smart optimization of the decoding time, compression level and progressive rendering
 *          (less iterations). This is the default mode when using q_auto.
 * * steep - Delivers a preview very quickly, and in a single later phase improves the image to
 *           the required resolution.
 * * none  - Use this to deliver a non-progressive image. This is the default mode when setting
 *           a specific value for quality.
 * @return {Flag}
