 * @description  Causes all semi-transparent pixels in an image to be either fully transparent or fully opaque.
 *
 * Each pixel with an opacity lower than the specified threshold value is set to an opacity of 0%. Each pixel with
 * an opacity greater than the specified threshold is set to an opacity of 100%. For example, setting
 * opacity_threshold:0 makes all pixels non-transparent, while opacity_threshold:100 makes all semi-transparent
 * pixels fully transparent. Note: This effect can be a useful solution when PhotoShop PSD files are delivered in a
 * format supporting partial transparency, such as PNG, and the results without this effect are not as expected.
 *
 * @param {number} level The level of the threshold. (Range: 1 to 100, Server default: 50)
